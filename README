This is a memory module simualtor that implements the clock variation of the second chance algorithm. It simulates processes randomly reading and writing to a frame table.

Arguments:
-h: Help; displays this.
-p: Number of user processes spawned (default 18)
-x: Percentage of read requests (default 50). Write requests take up the remaining percentage. Accepts 0-99.
-l: Changes the limit of requests made before a process checks for a 75 percent chance of termination (default 900). Accepts 1-2000.

Note: with default settings applied per the instructions, it will only ever fork 18 given the time limit. Here are some ways to increase this to get a better understanding of the functionality:

* Lower the request limit for users significantly ( -l command )
* Increase alarm interrupt from 2 seconds (329 oss.c)
* Increase time limit from 100 seconds (329 oss.c)
* Increase the amount of nanoseconds incremented every loop (156 oss.c)
* Lower the time taken for random requests to occur (25 user.c)
